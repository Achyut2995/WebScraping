# WebScraping
This project focuses on leveraging Python's web scraping capabilities to extract real-time weather data from the top 10 metropolitan cities in the United States. By utilizing popular libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, along with other supplementary tools.

The primary objective is to provide up-to-date weather data for each city, including temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, weather description, and current time. This information is valuable for various applications, including travel planning, event management, and daily activity scheduling.

By automating the data retrieval process through web scraping, Ensure that the weather data remains current and reliable, empowering users with timely insights into weather conditions across different regions. Additionally, the project showcases Python's versatility in handling web data extraction tasks efficiently and effectively.

Through this project, I demonstrate the potential of Python as a powerful tool for collecting and processing real-time data from the web, opening up opportunities for various data-driven applications and analyses.
